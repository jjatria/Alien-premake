=head1 NAME

Alien::premake5 - Build or find premake5

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Alien::premake5;
    use Env qw( @PATH );

    unshift @ENV, Alien::premake5->bin_dir;
    my $premake = Alien::premake5->exe;
    system $premake, 'gmake';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Premake is a build tool that allows a software project to be described with a
single common build script, which can then be used to generate project files
for building under a wide variety of build environments.

B<Alien::premake5> uses L<Alien::Build> to make it easier to use premake in a
Perl application or project.

This distribution will find an available version of C<premake5>, or attempt to
build one from source.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<exe>

    my $premake = Alien::premake5->exe;

Returns the name of the premake executable. Currently, this should be
C<premake5>.

When using the executable compiled by this distribution, you
will need to make sure that the directories returned by C<bin_dir> are added
to your C<PATH> environment variable. For more info, check the documentation
of L<Alien::Build>.

=item B<premake5>

The C<%{premake5}> string will be interpolated by Alien::Build into the name
of the premake5 executable (as returned by B<exe>);
